# Object_Detection_project_using_ml
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet Single Shot Detector (SSD) model. The system captures live video from your webcam, detects multiple objects in the scene, and draws green bounding boxes around them with labels and confidence scores.
# Live Object Detection
